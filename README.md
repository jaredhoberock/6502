* @OneLoneCoder's [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nViZg02IMQo&list=PLrOv9FMX8xJHqMvSGB_9G9nZZ_4IgteYf) was a helpful tutorial for learning about emulation, and his [PPU implementation](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES/blob/master/Part%20%234%20-%20PPU%20Backgrounds/olc2C02.cpp) was particularly useful in understanding the behavior of the NES' rendering algorithm.
* @amaiorano's [APU implementation](https://github.com/amaiorano/nes-emu/blob/master/src/Apu.cpp) was useful for understanding the behavior of the NES' APU and his design guided the one here.
